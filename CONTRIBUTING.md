## Contribution Guidelines

### Code of Conduct
Please, take a moment to read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/linkedin/brooklin/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Java Coding Style Guide
Our Java coding style guidelines are encoded in the [Checkstyle configuration file](https://github.com/linkedin/Brooklin/blob/master/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml) checked into this repo.

### Git Commit Messages Style Guide

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 120 characters
3. Wrap the body at 100 characters
4. Capitalize the subject line
5. Do not end the subject line with a period
6. Do not make references to internal Jira tickets

Here is an example of a good Git commit message:
> ```
> Summarize changes in up to 120 characters
>
> More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 100 characters or so. The blank line
> separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body entirely); tools like
> rebase can get confused if you run the two together. Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
>
>  - Bullet points are okay, too
>  - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a single space, with blank 
>    lines in between, but conventions vary here
> ```

### General Recommendations
- Use Apache Commons for argument validation.
- Make sure to include unit tests whether you are proposing a bug fix, a feature enhancement, or a brand new feature.
